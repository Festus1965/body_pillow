This is the body_pillow mod, by Duane Robertson, written more as a training exercise than anything useful.

You create a body pillow with the following recipe:
	empty, white wool, empty
	red wool, green wool, blue wool
	orange wool, violet wool, yellow wool

It looks nice and you can use it as a bed. The texture was made from public domain art available at the Open Clipart library (openclipart.org). However, it's easy to find better graphics with web search.

To turn the pillow over, (left) shift-click it, assuming you haven't remapped your sneak button.
